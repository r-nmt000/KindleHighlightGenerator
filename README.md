# Kindle Highlight Generator

This program arrange kindle highlights nicely and generate markdown file of it.

## What is the problem?

On kindle.amazon.co.jp(and maybe in other countries),  kindle highlights syncing
function does not work properly(not sync highlights of some books).

I really wanted to put all my highlights on Evernote easily and beautifully, so I need to find other way to do that.

This is the compromise! Now we can put our highlights on Evernote nicely!

## How to use

1. Copy 'My Clippings.txt' from your Kindle device to a directory where
   main.py is
2. execute commands below
```
python main.py
input file name > My Clippings.txt
output file name > output.txt
```
3. You'll get nicely arranged markdown file as output!
4. Open output with some markdown editor(wri.pe is nice cuz it can sync note
   with Evernote).
